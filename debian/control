Description: Parsing gigabytes of JSON per second (shared object)
 JSON documents are everywhere on the Internet. Servers spend a lot of time
 parsing these documents. We want to accelerate the parsing of JSON per se
 using commonly available SIMD instructions as much as possible while doing
 full validation (including character encoding).
 .
 It has a special requirement:
  - A processor with AVX2 (i.e., Intel processors starting with the Haswell
    microarchitecture released 2013, and processors from AMD starting with
    the Ryzen)
 .
 This package ships the shared object.
