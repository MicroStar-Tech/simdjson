Description: Parsing gigabytes of JSON per second (shared object)
 JSON is everywhere on the Internet. Servers spend a *lot* of time parsing it.
 The simdjson library uses commonly available SIMD instructions and
 microparallel algorithms to parse JSON 2.5x faster than anything else out
 there.
 .
 Fast: Over 2.5x faster than other production-grade JSON parsers.
 Easy: First-class, easy to use API.
 Strict: Full JSON and UTF-8 validation, lossless parsing.
         Performance with no compromises.
 Automatic: Selects a CPU-tailored parser at runtime.
            No configuration needed.
 Reliable: From memory allocation to error handling,
           simdjson's design avoids surprises.
 .
 This package ships the shared object.
